# üí°RandomIdeas App

This is a full-stack application for sharing random ideas. It is a bonus project from Brad Traversy's [**Modern JS From The Beginning 2.0**](https://www.traversymedia.com/modern-javascript-2-0) course. This project goes beyond the fundamentals and gave me a valuable taste of what full-stack development is like. I highly recommend the course!

This app includes a Node.js/Express REST API that uses MongoDB for a database. The client-side is built with Webpack.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### Install Dependencies

Install dependencies on the front-end and back-end

```bash
npm install
cd client
npm install
```

### Back-end/Express Server

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
npm run dev (Nodemon)
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000`

### Front-end/Webpack Dev Server

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`

To build front-end production files

```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

The production build will be put into the `public` folder, which is the Express static folder.

### Environment Variables

Rename `.env-example` to `.env` and add your MongoDB URI to the `.env` file.

```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
```

## üõ£Ô∏è REST Endpoints

### Ideas

| Endpoint       | Description    | Method | Body                    |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| /api/ideas     | Get all ideas  | GET    | None                    |
| /api/ideas/:id | Get idea by id | GET    | None                    |
| /api/ideas     | Add idea       | POST   | { text, tag, username } |
| /api/ideas/:id | Update idea    | PUT    | { text, tag, username } |
| /api/ideas/:id | Delete idea    | DELETE | username                |

When updating or deleting an idea, the username must match the username of the idea's creator. This mimics basic user authentication and adds a layer of simple security.
